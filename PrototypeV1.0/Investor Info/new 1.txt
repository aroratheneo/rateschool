VCs-
Gopal Modi, President, Investments, Orios Venture Partners

You can approach a VC by seeking an introduction through fellow entrepreneurs who may have received funding from them. Adds Modi: "Approaching through known networks like exist ing entrepreneurs always works in their favour. VC funds are more receptive to those referred by other successful entrepreneurs." When you finally meet the potential investors, be prepared to answer several questions. CGTMSE LOANS Under the Credit Guarantee Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme, meant to encourage entrepreneurs, one can get loans of up to `1 crore without collateral or surety. Any new and existing micro and small enterprise can take the loan under the scheme from all scheduled commercial banks and specified Regional Rural Banks, NSIC, NEDFi, and SIDBI, which have signed an agreement with the Trust.

Banks & NBFCs 

Loans from banks and NBFCs help finance the purchase of inventory and equipment, besides securing operating capital and funds for expansion. More importantly, unlike a VC or angel, which have an equity stake, banks do not seek ownership in your venture.However, there are several drawbacks.Not only do you pay interest on loan but it also has to be done on time irrespective of how your business is faring.They require substantial collateral and a good track record, besides the fulfilment of other terms and conditions.They also entail a lot of paperwork.
